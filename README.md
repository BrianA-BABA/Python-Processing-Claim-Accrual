# Python-Processing-Claim-Accrual

This Python script processes claim data by distributing claim amounts across a specified episode date range. It automates the allocation of claim amounts per day, ensuring accurate accrual calculations. The script:

- Reads claim data from a CSV file.
- Parses episode date ranges and distributes claim amounts evenly across those dates.
- Adjusts daily allocations to match the exact claim amount.
- Saves the processed data into a new CSV file for further analysis.

This automation streamlines financial reporting and enhances data accuracy for revenue tracking.
